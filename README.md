# std_lists
A collection of lists of common things in CSV format. 

I often write small scripts, such as Twitter Bots which select random items from lists. I've started to gather these together here. Each is a CSV file, with no header row. The filename denotes what it contains.

Where I didn't fully compile the list myself, I've given the source after the file name / link. 

##  The Lists
* [Aberdeen Areas](aberdeen_areas.csv)
* [Aberdeenshire Towns](aberdeenshire_towns_suburbs.csv) 
* [Aberdeenshire Villages](aberdeenshire_villages_locales.csv) 
* [Animals](animals.csv) # 
* [Body Parts](body_parts.csv) #
* [Countries](countries.csv) 
* [Demonyms](demonyms.csv)
* [Feminine Names](feminine_names.csv) #
* [Fruits](fruits.csv)
* [Masculine Names](masculine_names.csv) #
* [Occupations](occupations.csv) - Source: https://github.com/johnlsheridan/occupations
* [Persons](persons.csv) - note overlap with Occupations # 
* [Surnames](surnames.csv) # 
* [Vegetables](vegetables.csv)
* [Vehicles](vehicles.csv) #

Please feel free to reuse and build new stuff with these lists.
